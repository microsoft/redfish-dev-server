# RAS Endpoint Configuration

The RAS endpoint simulator reads platform-owned endpoint settings from the
file selected by the RAS plugin's `endpoint_config` setting in
`platform_config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ras",
  "enabled": true,
  "config": {
    "endpoint_config": "ras_endpoint_config.json"
  }
}
```

Relative paths are resolved under the platform mockup directory. Absolute
paths are accepted. If the setting is omitted, the compatibility default is
`ras_endpoint_config.json` under the mockup directory.

The RAS Gen 1 platform therefore uses
[`mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config.json`](../../../mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config.json).
Restart the server after changing this file.

The generic endpoint fields identify and route RAS records. The `memory` object
is provider-specific configuration used by the Contoso endpoint implementation.
The plugin selects proprietary action behavior by the configured `creator_id`;
there is no separate vendor-name field.

The configuration is authoritative for:

- RAS endpoint identity and supported queues
- Internal memory-repair capabilities reported in Contoso CPERs
- Installed memory topology and DIMM capacities
- DIMM SPD identity data
- The default SPD-device temperature reported for each DIMM
- Per-DIMM repair limits

## Startup Summary

When the RAS plugin initializes, it prints the resolved absolute endpoint
configuration path and a summary of the simulated machine:

```text

This is printed from the plugin so users can confirm which endpoint file and
hardware model the running BMC simulator actually loaded.

Memory-repair capabilities are not published on the Redfish RAS endpoint
resource. They are encoded in each Contoso memory-controller CPER.

## Top-Level Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `platform_id` | Yes | Platform ID used by every configured endpoint. |
| `ras_endpoints` | Yes | Non-empty array of RAS endpoint definitions. |

Endpoint IDs and partition IDs must be unique within the file.

## Endpoint Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Redfish RAS endpoint resource ID. |
| `creator_id` | Yes | Creator ID identifying the endpoint, analyzer, and proprietary action owner. |
| `name` | Yes | Display name. |
| `partition_id` | Yes | Partition ID used to route CPERs and CPADs. |
| `description` | Yes | Endpoint description. |
| `endpoint_type` | Yes | Endpoint type, such as `Processor`. |
| `fru_id` | Yes | Field-replaceable unit ID. |
| `fru_text` | Yes | Human-readable FRU description. |
| `supported_queues` | Yes | CPER queues advertised by the endpoint. |
| `provider_config` | No | Vendor-specific settings made available to the endpoint action provider. |
| `memory` | No | Provider-specific installed-memory configuration. Required by the Contoso provider. |

Identity and queue fields are published through Redfish discovery. Memory
repair capabilities are consumed internally and placed only in Contoso memory
CPERs.

An endpoint owned by another CreatorID may omit `memory` and place its
vendor-specific settings in `provider_config`. The generic discovery and CPAD
routing paths do not interpret that object or require Contoso memory topology.

A submitted CPAD is routed by `partition_id`, and its CreatorID must match the
configured `creator_id` for that endpoint. Proprietary ActionIDs are interpreted
using the pair `(creator_id, ActionID)`, allowing other vendors to reuse numeric
IDs without invoking Contoso behavior.

## System Reset Scope

The current mockup exposes one Redfish ComputerSystem. A successful `On`,
`GracefulRestart`, `ForceRestart`, or `PowerCycle` therefore resets every
configured SoC endpoint partition. A pending Contoso reboot-with-retraining
action retrains all memory controllers in its target SoC partition.

`ForceOff` and `GracefulShutdown` do not perform retraining. See
[Contoso CPAD Actions](../../../examples/ras_api_demo/analyzers/contoso/contoso-cpad-actions.md)
for the complete action lifecycle.

## Memory Repair Capabilities

```json
{
  "soft_ppr_runtime_supported": true,
  "soft_ppr_boot_time_supported": true,
  "hard_ppr_boot_time_supported": true
}
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `soft_ppr_runtime_supported` | `false` | The endpoint can execute soft PPR immediately at runtime. |
| `soft_ppr_boot_time_supported` | `false` | Firmware supports soft PPR during boot. |
| `hard_ppr_boot_time_supported` | `false` | Firmware supports hard PPR during boot. |

All values must be JSON booleans. PPR action `0x8001` carries one PPR type bit
matching this capability field. Runtime soft PPR executes immediately.
Boot-time soft and hard PPR are queued until `On`, restart, or power-cycle.

The Contoso memory CPER stores these values in a one-byte bitfield:

| Bit | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Soft PPR at runtime |
| 1 | Soft PPR at boot time |
| 2 | Hard PPR at boot time |
| 7:3 | Reserved; always zero |

## Memory Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `memory_organization` | Yes | None | Uniform DIMM size and address-translation scheme for the platform. |
| `socket` | No | `0` | Socket represented by this endpoint's memory inventory. |
| `memory_repair_capabilities` | No | All flags `false` | Internal PPR support flags reported in Contoso memory CPERs. |
| `channels_per_chiplet` | No | `2` | Channel slots on each chiplet. Valid range: 1-256. |
| `dimms_per_channel` | No | `2` | DIMM slots on each channel. Valid range: 1-256. |
| `memory_controllers` | Yes | None | Memory controllers and installed DIMMs. |

`memory_organization` is intentionally listed first and should appear before
`memory_controllers` in configuration files: it describes the platform-wide
DIMM geometry and address mapping, while `memory_controllers` contains the
detailed installed-DIMM inventory. JSON member order does not affect parsing;
files using the earlier order remain fully supported.

The Contoso demo has two chiplets (`0` and `1`) and one memory controller (`0`)
per chiplet. A DIMM entry means its slot is populated. Omit an entry to
simulate an empty slot.

Each memory controller contains:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chiplet` | Yes | Contoso chiplet index, `0` or `1`. |
| `controller` | Yes | Contoso memory-controller index; currently `0`. |
| `dimms` | Yes | Array of installed DIMMs; may be empty. |

## DIMM and SPD Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `channel` | Yes | None | Channel containing the DIMM. |
| `dimm` | Yes | None | DIMM slot on the channel. |
| `fru_id` | Yes | None | DIMM FRU GUID used by CPAD descriptors. |
| `fru_text` | Yes | None | Human-readable DIMM FRU text. |

DIMM capacity is platform-wide rather than repeated in every DIMM:

```json
"memory_organization": {
  "version": 1,
  "address_translation": "contoso-simple-v1",
  "dimm_size_gib": 64
}
```

`dimm_size_gib` must be 32, 64, or 128. All installed DIMMs therefore share
one organization. If a platform has multiple memory endpoints, their
organization blocks must match. Per-DIMM `size_bytes` is rejected.

Each DIMM requires `fru_id` and `fru_text` so physical addresses can be
resolved to a CPAD descriptor FRU.

| `max_repairs_per_bank` | No | `16` | Per-bank repair limit, from 0 through 255. |
| `spd` | Yes | None | SPD identity data captured in memory CPERs. |

`max_repairs_per_bank` value `0` disables repairs on that DIMM. A repair after
the configured limit fails without changing the bank count.

The `spd` object contains:

| Field | Required | CPER capacity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `serial_number` | Yes | 18 ASCII characters | DIMM serial number. |
| `part_number` | Yes | 24 ASCII characters | DIMM part number. |
| `module_manufacturer_id` | Yes | 2 bytes | Module assembler JEP106 ID in DDR5 SPD order. |
| `dram_manufacturer_id` | Yes | 2 bytes | DRAM manufacturer JEP106 ID in DDR5 SPD order. |
| `spd_temperature` | No | Signed byte | Default SPD-device temperature in degrees Celsius; defaults to `40`, valid range `-127..127`. |

On real hardware, SPD temperature is a dynamic measurement. The demo does not
yet expose a control for changing it at runtime, so this configured value is
normally reported in each memory-controller CPER for that DIMM. A Contoso
error-injection CPAD may override it for one injected error to demonstrate how
DRAM-vendor analyzers use temperature. Keeping the default in the per-DIMM SPD
object also leaves room for a future runtime temperature control.

The demo uses Microsoft for both manufacturer IDs:

```json
["0x04", "0xD5"]
```

## Minimal Example

This example configures one endpoint with one installed 64 GiB DIMM. Other
slots are empty. The complete RAS Gen 1 example contains two chiplets and eight
DIMMs in
[`ras_endpoint_config.json`](../../../mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config.json).

```

## Derived CPER Data

The endpoint computes `total_memory_bytes` by multiplying the installed DIMM
count by `memory_organization.dimm_size_gib`.
DIMM installed on that endpoint. Do not configure a separate total. The full
RAS Gen 1 configuration contains eight 64 GiB DIMMs, so its CPER value is
`549755813888` bytes (512 GiB).

When the endpoint emits a Contoso memory CPER, it overwrites submitted values
with authoritative configuration and runtime state for:

- SPD serial number and part number
- Module and DRAM manufacturer IDs
- SPD-device temperature, unless the error-injection CPAD supplies an override
- Total endpoint memory
- Memory-repair capability bitfield
- Sparse per-DIMM bank repair counts

Repair counts reset to zero when the server restarts. Banks omitted from the
sparse repair list have zero repairs.

## Validation Rules

The plugin rejects invalid endpoint configuration, including:

- Duplicate endpoint IDs or partition IDs
- Missing endpoint identity fields
- Non-boolean repair capability values
- Chiplet, controller, channel, or DIMM indices outside configured limits
- Duplicate DIMM addresses
- Unsupported platform-wide DIMM sizes
- Repair limits outside `0..255`
- Missing, non-ASCII, or overlength SPD strings
- Invalid two-byte odd-parity JEP106 manufacturer IDs

Validate a file with the production loader:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c 'from src.plugins.ras.memory_config import RASEndpointConfiguration; RASEndpointConfiguration.load("mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config.json")'
```

## Start the Endpoint

```bash
python servers/redfishMockupServer_platform.py -D mockups/ras_gen1 -p 8000
```

The plugin loads the configured endpoint file once and injects the same parsed
`RASEndpointConfiguration` into discovery and SubmitCPAD handling. If an
explicitly configured file is absent or invalid, RAS plugin initialization
fails. When `endpoint_config` is omitted, the legacy default filename remains
optional for compatibility.
