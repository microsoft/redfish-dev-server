# Policy Engine

The **Policy Engine** ([`policy.py`](policy.py), class `PolicyEngine`) is the
Server Fleet Operator's gate that decides whether a **proposed RAS action**
(a CPAD produced by a vendor analyzer) is allowed to run on the hardware.

It is **table-driven**: all policy lives in two JSON files under
[`policy_tables/`](policy_tables), which the engine loads at construction. The
engine itself is small, self-contained, and has **no server dependencies**. It
decodes the binary CPAD with cperlib, reads local JSON policy tables, and
returns a decision.

## Where it sits in the pipeline

```
vendor analyzer  ──►  emits a binary CPAD (a proposed action)
                          │
                   PolicyEngine.evaluate_cpad()   ◄── operator policy gate (tables)
                          │
              approved ───┴─── denied
                 │                 │
          CPADSubmitter      create-platform-action-cper (POLICY_REJECTED)
          POST to host             │
                          store_cper → event listener → cper_storage/
                                    │
                          orchestrator analyzes it like any host CPER
```

A CPAD is only a *recommendation*. The analyzer never acts on its own; the
operator's policy engine must approve it before `CPADSubmitter` sends it back to
the reporting host. Driven from `AnalysisOrchestrator._policy_and_submit()`,
which calls `policy_engine.evaluate_cpad(cpad_binary)` and, on denial, emits a
rejection CPER (see [Rejections](#rejections-policy_rejected-cper)).

## What it inspects (and what it does not)

The engine decodes the binary CPAD in memory, then reads only its **header** and
**section descriptors**:

- `header.creatorID`, `header.platformID`, `header.partitionID`, and
  `header.urgency`
- `sectionDescriptors[].actionId` / `actionID.code`,
  `sectionDescriptors[].confidence`, `sectionDescriptors[].urgency`, and
  `fruText`

It never interprets the opaque vendor **section body**. So it can tell *that* an
action is, say, an error injection or PPR (from the action id in the section
descriptor), but not the private details inside the section. That keeps
proprietary vendor data private while still letting the operator gate on
identity, action type, target platform, confidence, and urgency.

Confidence and urgency are analyzer-provided policy inputs. Policy may deny an
action based on either field and may prioritize an approved urgent action. The
endpoint does not use either field when executing the action.

Analyzers do not emit JSON CPAD sidecars. Any JSON representation used while
assembling a CPAD is temporary; the policy engine obtains its decoded view
directly from the binary `.cpad`.

## The policy tables

Two JSON files, loaded at construction (defaults shown; override via constructor
args or the CLI `--creators` / `--actions` flags).

### `policy_tables/creators.json` — who is trusted

Maps a **CreatorID** to a trust record.

```json
{
  "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555": {
    "name": "Contoso",
    "trusted": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| *(key)* | CreatorID GUID (lowercase) |
| `name` | Human-friendly owner name (display only) |
| `trusted` | `true` ⇒ creator is trusted; anything else ⇒ denied at Rule 1 |

### `policy_tables/actions.json` — what each creator may do

Indexed by **CreatorID → ActionID**, so each row is the policy for one action
type from one creator.

```json
{
  "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555": {
    "0x0002": {
      "name": "Power Cycle",
      "permitted": true,
      "urgency_policy": "any",
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x0003": {
      "name": "Reseat Part",
      "permitted": true,
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x0004": {
      "name": "Shuffle Part",
      "permitted": true,
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x0005": {
      "name": "Replace Part",
      "permitted": true,
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x0006": {
      "name": "Error Injection",
      "permitted": true,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x8001": {
      "name": "PPR (Post Package Repair)",
      "permitted": true,
      "urgency_policy": "any",
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x8002": {
      "name": "Page Offline",
      "permitted": true,
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    },
    "0x8003": {
      "name": "Reboot with Memory Retraining",
      "permitted": true,
      "confidence_threshold": 80,
      "supported_platforms": ["990f8820-bd4d-5064-58cc-961a053dea79"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| *(outer key)* | CreatorID GUID |
| *(inner key)* | ActionID as a hex string (e.g. `0x0006`, `0x8001`) |
| `name` | Human-friendly action name (display only) |
| `permitted` | `true` ⇒ action is allowed; `false` ⇒ denied at Rule 3 |
| `confidence_threshold` | *Optional.* If present, the CPAD's section-descriptor `confidence` must be `>=` this value. **Omit it to apply no confidence gate** (e.g. error injection). |
| `urgency_policy` | *Optional.* `any` allows either value, `urgent_only` requires urgent, and `non_urgent_only` rejects urgent. Omitted behaves as `any`. |
| `supported_platforms` | List of PlatformID GUIDs on which this action is allowed |

**Why `confidence_threshold` is optional:** the policy engine only sees the
action *type* from the section descriptor. For an error injection (`0x0006`) it
cannot tell what error is being injected, and confidence is not meaningful — so
that row simply omits `confidence_threshold` and the confidence rule is skipped.
Analyzer-driven remediations such as PPR (`0x8001`), Page Offline (`0x8002`),
and reboot with memory retraining (`0x8003`) carry the analyzer's confidence
and are gated (here at `80`). Omitting the field is preferred over a `0`
threshold because it is unambiguous ("no confidence policy" versus "threshold
of zero").

Note that proprietary CPAD ActionIDs (0x8000 to 0xFFFF) are specific to a particular CreatorID.  This means that proprietary ActionIDs may have different meanings for different vendors (CreatorIDs). 

The Contoso definitions are documented in
[Contoso CPAD Actions](analyzers/contoso/contoso-cpad-actions.md).

## The rules

`evaluate_cpad()` approves a CPAD only if **all** applicable rules pass; it
denies on the first failure and records the reason.

| # | Rule | Check |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | **Creator trust** | `creators[creatorID].trusted == true` |
| 2 | **Known action** | `actions[creatorID][actionID]` exists |
| 3 | **Permitted** | that row's `permitted == true` |
| 4 | **Platform supported** | `platformID ∈ row.supported_platforms` |
| 5 | **Confidence** | if the row has `confidence_threshold`, require `confidence >= threshold`; if absent, not evaluated |
| 6 | **Urgency** | apply `urgency_policy`; omitted or `any` accepts both values |

Every section must pass every rule or the entire CPAD is denied. An urgent
section must still pass every other rule. For each approved urgent section,
the policy engine marks it prioritized and prints:

```text
⚡ Prioritizing approved urgent action
   Action: Replace Part (0x0005)
   FRU Text: DIMM A1
   FRU ID: 75824856-bd36-2cc8-61f4-39bb3276da2a
```

This signal allows server-fleet workflows to accelerate special data-center
handling such as DIMM replacement or coordinated reboot. The demo reports the
priority but does not implement a physical-work queue.

## Rejections (POLICY_REJECTED CPER)

When a CPAD is denied, the action is **not** sent to the host. Instead the
orchestrator records the rejection as a first-class event the analyzer can see:

1. `create-platform-action-cper <cpad> --return-code 0x03 --reason-code 0x00`
   turns the rejected CPAD into a **Platform Action CPER** whose
   `actionReturnCode` is `EFI_PLATFORM_ACTION_RETURN_CODE_POLICY_REJECTED (0x03)`
   with reason `EFI_PLATFORM_ACTION_REASON_CODE_NONE (0x00)`. (Both constants are
   defined in `src/plugins/ras/libcper/include/libcper/Cper.h`.)
2. The orchestrator sends the bytes to the event listener via a `store_cper`
   command; the listener writes them under
   `cper_storage/{platformID}/{partitionID}/` — the same tree as host CPERs —
   and sends the usual `cper_downloaded` notification.
3. The orchestrator picks it up like any other CPER and routes it to the
   analyzer, which reports the `POLICY_REJECTED` action result.

The `PolicyEngine` itself only makes the decision; the orchestrator owns the
cperlib call and delivery. `PolicyDecision` carries the `return_code` /
`reason_code` constants so the "what" is expressed in policy and the "how" is
plumbing.

## `PolicyDecision`

`evaluate_cpad()` returns a `PolicyDecision` (truthy when allowed):

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `allowed` | Approved (`True`) or denied (`False`) |
| `reason` | Human-readable denial reason (`None` when allowed) |
| `creator_id`, `platform_id`, `action_id`, `action_name`, `fru_id`, `fru_text` | Compatibility view of the first section's normalized action context |
| `confidence`, `threshold` | The CPAD confidence and the applied threshold (`None` if not gated) |
| `urgency`, `prioritized` | Analyzer urgency and whether an approved action should receive accelerated handling |
| `section_decisions` | Per-section action, FRU, confidence, urgency, priority, and allow/deny result |
| `return_code`, `reason_code` | Platform Action codes to stamp on a rejection CPER |

## API

```python
from policy import PolicyEngine

engine = PolicyEngine()                      # loads policy_tables/*.json
decision = engine.evaluate_cpad("action.cpad") # -> PolicyDecision (truthy if allowed)
if decision.allowed:
    ...
else:
    print(decision.reason)

# Custom tables:
engine = PolicyEngine(creators_path="c.json", actions_path="a.json")

# Batch:
results = engine.evaluate_multiple_cpads([p1, p2])   # [(path, PolicyDecision), ...]
```

## Standalone CLI

```bash
python examples/ras_api_demo/policy.py path/to/action.cpad [more.cpad ...]
python examples/ras_api_demo/policy.py --creators c.json --actions a.json action.cpad
```

Prints a rule-by-rule trace and a final `APPROVED` / `DENIED` per file; exit code
is `0` if every CPAD is approved, `1` otherwise.

## Extending policy

Edit the JSON files — no code changes:

- **New trusted vendor** → add a CreatorID entry to `creators.json`.
- **New action** → add `actions[creatorID][actionID]` with `permitted`,
  `supported_platforms`, `urgency_policy`, and (optionally)
  `confidence_threshold`.
- **Allow an action on more platforms** → add PlatformIDs to that row's
  `supported_platforms`.

For a real deployment these files would be backed by an operator-managed policy
source, and additional rules (rate limits, maintenance windows, blast-radius
limits) would slot in alongside the existing ones.
