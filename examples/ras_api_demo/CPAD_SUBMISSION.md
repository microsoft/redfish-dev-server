# CPAD Submission

A **CPAD** (Common Platform Action Descriptor) is a binary record describing a
*proposed action* — an error injection, a repair such as SPPR, or a rejection —
that is sent **to** a RAS API endpoint. This document describes how a CPAD is
submitted to the BMC and the checks the BMC runs before it accepts one.

Two pieces of code implement this flow:

- **Client side** — [`submit_cpad.py`](submit_cpad.py) (`CPADSubmitter`): reads a
  binary `.cpad`, base64-encodes it, and POSTs it as JSON.
- **BMC / plugin side** — [`submit_cpad_action.py`](../../src/plugins/ras/handlers/submit_cpad_action.py)
  (`SubmitCPADActionHandler`): decodes, validates, runs the acceptance checks,
  and (on acceptance) performs the action.

## Transport

```
POST /redfish/v1/Oem/OpenCompute_FaultMgmt/RASService/Actions/RASService.SubmitCPAD
Content-Type: application/json

{ "CPADData": "<base64 of the binary CPAD>", "EncodingType": "Base64" }
```

The binary CPAD is base64-encoded and wrapped in JSON so it travels over a
standard Redfish action without a separate binary upload channel. The BMC
base64-decodes it and reconstructs the original bytes.

## Client-side steps

With `--verbose`, [`submit_cpad.py`](submit_cpad.py) narrates each step:

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Load the binary `.cpad` file and validate its `CPAD` signature. |
| 2 | Parse the header to read `PlatformID` and `PartitionID`. |
| 3 | Look up the target BMC URL by `PlatformID` (supports a multi-BMC map). |
| 4 | Base64-encode the bytes and POST the JSON payload to the BMC. |
| 5 | Receive the response. `202 Accepted` (or `2xx`) means the BMC accepted it. |
| 6 | **Store the accepted CPAD** in the infrastructure database, keyed by `PlatformID`/`PartitionID`. |
| 7 | **Listen for the Platform Action CPER(s)** that report the *outcome* of the action. |

### Why store (step 6) comes before listening (step 7)

Acceptance (`202`) is the BMC's commitment to *process* the CPAD — it is **not**
confirmation that the action has run. The endpoint may act much later, once
preconditions are met (maintenance windows, quiescing, etc.). The client
therefore **records the CPAD as soon as it is accepted** (step 6) so the pending
action is never lost, and *only then* waits for the Platform Action CPER(s) that
report success or failure (step 7). These two concerns are deliberately
decoupled: "the BMC accepted it" and "the endpoint eventually acted on it" are
different events, potentially far apart in time.

## BMC-side processing

[`SubmitCPADActionHandler.handle_submit_cpad`](../../src/plugins/ras/handlers/submit_cpad_action.py)
runs these stages. The first failure returns an error and stops.

1. **Field check** — require `EncodingType: "Base64"` and a `CPADData` field
   (else `400`).
2. **Decode & signature** — base64-decode, require the minimum header size and
   the `CPAD` signature (else `400`).
3. **Decode to JSON** — convert the binary CPAD to JSON with cperlib
   (`cpad-convert to-json`) so the header/section descriptors can be inspected
   (a tool failure is `500`).
4. **Structure validation** — require a header, at least one section descriptor,
   the required header fields, and a `sectionCount` that matches the number of
   descriptors (else `400`).
5. **Acceptance checks (spec §6.5)** — see below. These gate the `202`.
6. **Acceptance gate** — once §6.5 passes, the CPAD is **Accepted (`202`)**.

For a multi-section CPAD, the endpoint validates the shared envelope once and
then executes each section independently using its ActionID, body, FRU ID, and
FRU text. A Platform Action Event preserves the originating CPAD section
index, so sections targeting different FRUs remain independently correlated.
7. **Post-acceptance action** — select an endpoint action provider using the
   target endpoint's CreatorID, then execute or schedule the action. Error
   injection is the only action that creates an error CPER. Immediate actions
   create a Platform Action Event now; deferred actions create one when they
   complete. A failure here does **not** revoke acceptance.

### Acceptance checks (spec §6.5)

| Check | Rule | On failure |
|---|---|---|
| **PlatformID** | The CPAD's `platformID` must equal the BMC's own `PlatformID`. | `400` `OCPRAS.1.0.PlatformIDMismatch` |
| **PartitionID** | The CPAD's `partitionID` must map to a known RAS endpoint (`RASService/RASEndpoints`). | `404` `OCPRAS.1.0.PartitionIDUnknown` |
| **CreatorID** | The CPAD's `creatorID` must match the configured owner of the target endpoint. | `400` `OCPRAS.1.0.CPADValidationFailed` |
| **Well-formed length** | `recordLength` must be consistent with the payload: `header-min ≤ recordLength ≤ received-bytes`. | `400` `OCPRAS.1.0.CPADValidationFailed` |

> **Note on the length rule.** Per `Cpad.h`, the received buffer *may be larger*
> than the declared record (room to append section descriptors). So the check is
> a bound (`recordLength ≤ received-bytes`), not strict equality — it rejects a
> truncated payload or an absurd `recordLength` while allowing legitimate
> trailing buffer space.

The BMC sources its `PlatformID`, valid `PartitionID`s, and endpoint CreatorIDs
from the RAS plugin's configured endpoint file
([`ras_endpoint_config.json`](../../mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config.json)
by default), so the checks stay in sync with what the service advertises.

### Why `202` means "Accepted", not "Done"

`202 Accepted` is returned **once the acceptance checks pass** — before the
action necessarily completes. Immediate actions normally emit their Platform
Action Event during submission. Deferred actions, such as Contoso reboot with
memory retraining, emit it after their completion condition occurs. The event
reports the actual result. This is the same principle the client honors with
its store-then-listen ordering (steps 6 → 7).

## Error responses

Rejections return a standard Redfish error body so the client can react
programmatically:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "@Message.ExtendedInfo": [
      {
        "MessageId": "OCPRAS.1.0.PlatformIDMismatch",
        "Message": "CPAD PlatformID <x> does not match this platform (<y>).",
        "MessageArgs": ["<x>", "<y>"],
        "Severity": "Warning",
        "Resolution": "Correct the request body and resubmit."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

| HTTP | MessageId | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `202` | *(success — Task body)* | CPAD accepted for processing |
| `400` | `Base.1.16.ActionParameterMissing` | Missing `EncodingType`/`CPADData` |
| `400` | `OCPRAS.1.0.CPADValidationFailed` | Bad signature/size, structure, length, or endpoint CreatorID |
| `400` | `OCPRAS.1.0.PlatformIDMismatch` | CPAD targets a different platform |
| `404` | `OCPRAS.1.0.PartitionIDUnknown` | PartitionID does not map to a known endpoint |
| `500` | `OCPRAS.1.0.CPADConversionFailed` | `cpad-convert` could not decode the CPAD |

## Where submission sits in the demo

The demo supports these CPAD actions:

- **Power Cycle, Reseat Part, Shuffle Part, and Replace Part CPADs**
  (`0x0002` through `0x0005`) that are policy checked and routed to the
  simulated server-fleet control plane rather than the Contoso endpoint.
- **Error Injection CPADs** (`0x0006`). The ActionID does not identify the
  injected error type; the CreatorID-specific endpoint interprets the section
  type and body. This demo's Contoso injector uses one such CPAD to create the
  corrected DRAM errors the analyzer studies.
- **PPR repair CPADs** (`0x8001`) that the analyzer emits and the
  [PolicyEngine](POLICY_ENGINE.md) approves.
- **Page Offline CPADs** (`0x8002`) that forward one or more 4 KiB physical
  pages to the simulated OS using compact PFN-list, range, or bitmap encoding.
  The endpoint prints the result but retains no offline-page state.
- **Reboot with Memory Retraining CPADs** (`0x8003`) that remain pending until
  `On`, restart, or power-cycle resets the target SoC partition.

The proprietary Contoso behavior is defined in
[Contoso CPAD Actions](analyzers/contoso/contoso-cpad-actions.md).

Error-injection CPADs carry the original Contoso error section because that
body describes the error to create. Remediation CPADs use the independent
Contoso action-parameter section
`a813b17b-db08-416b-810c-172668affb28`; their ActionID selects the PPR, Page
Offline, or Reboot with Retraining parameter codec.

See the [end-to-end walkthrough](README.md#end-to-end-walkthrough) for how
submission fits into the full inject → analyze → policy → submit → repair loop,
and [analyzer-orchestrator.md](analyzer-orchestrator.md) for the component that
drives submission after policy approval.
