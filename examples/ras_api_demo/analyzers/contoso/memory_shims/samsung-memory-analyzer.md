# Samsung Memory Analyzer Adapter

The Samsung shim adapts canonical Contoso memory events to a Samsung-oriented
record model and translates Samsung decisions into complete version 5 Contoso
action requests.

Implementation: [`analyzer_samsung.py`](analyzer_samsung.py)

## Running the Samsung demo

The Samsung demo is a separate pipeline; the generic `run_ras_demo.sh` /
`ras_api_plugin_demo.py` flow is unchanged and does not use any Samsung file.

```bash
bash examples/ras_api_demo/run_samsung_ras_demo.sh
```

or manually:

```bash
python servers/redfishMockupServer_platform.py -D mockups/ras_gen1 -p 8000 \
    --endpoint-config ras_endpoint_config_samsung.json
python examples/ras_api_demo/ras_api_samsung_demo.py
```

- `mockups/ras_gen1/ras_endpoint_config_samsung.json` configures chiplet 0,
  controller 0, channel 0, dimm 1 with DRAM manufacturer ID `80 CE`.
- Errors are injected from
  `cpad_storage/contososamsungMemErrorSpoof.inject.json`.
- Discovery lists the loaded memory-vendor analyzers (Samsung demo only).
- `samsung_dfa.py` must be present next to this shim and define callable
  `analyze(records)`. The Samsung-specific demo fails at startup if this
  dependency is unavailable. The generic demo may use default Contoso analysis
  when no Samsung shim is registered. If a registered shim fails at runtime,
  no Contoso remediation is substituted and no CPAD is emitted that cycle.

## Analyzer call contract

The shim calls the Samsung analysis seam as:

```python
result = analyze(records)
```

`records` is a newest-first list containing all relevant `memory_error` and
correlated `platform_action` records inside the current lookback window. The
analyzer is stateless; the framework rebuilds this list for every invocation.
A Platform Action record may therefore appear before the older memory error
that caused the action. No configuration object is passed across the adapter
interface.

The number of spare rows per bank is Samsung proprietary data owned by
`analyze()`. It is not read from the Contoso CPER, stored in the adapter, or
included in the records passed to the analyzer.

## Complete memory-error input record

The following example shows every field passed to `analyze()` for a memory
error:

```python
{
    "record_type": "memory_error",

        "failing_beat_count": 2,
    },
}
```

Fields copied from absent or invalid CPER fields may be `None`, an empty
string, an empty list, or zero according to the source decoder. The adapter
rejects a memory-error record unless `dimm.dram_manufacturer_id` is
`[0x80, 0xCE]`.

### Memory-error field notes

- `source.cper_file` and `source.section_index` uniquely identify the original
  memory-error section. An action recommendation must reference these exact
  values.
- `source.window_index` is zero for the newest record, one for the next-oldest
  record, and so on.
- `error.severity` is the decoded Contoso proprietary error severity.
  `cper_severity` is the record-level CPER severity.
- `location.dram_device` becomes `parameters.device` in a PPR request.
- `ppr.capability_bits` uses bit `0x01` for runtime soft PPR, `0x02` for
  boot-time soft PPR, and `0x04` for boot-time hard PPR.
- `ppr.target_bank_repair_count` is the count for the exact target tuple
  `(subchannel, rank, device, bank_group, bank)`.
- `ppr.repair_history` contains every repair entry supplied by the endpoint,
  not only the target bank.
- The adapter intentionally does not provide a total or remaining spare-row
  count. The Samsung analyzer combines its proprietary device knowledge with
  `target_bank_repair_count` internally.
- Each `beats.mask_by_dq[dq]` value is a 16-bit beat mask for one DQ. Bit
  `beat` is set when that DQ failed on that beat.
- `beats.mask_64` concatenates the DQ masks with DQ 0 in the least-significant
  16 bits. The remaining fields are derived summaries of the same masks.

## Complete Platform Action Event input record

Platform Action Events tell the analyzer the status of a previously sent CPAD.
The following example shows every field passed for an action result correlated
with older memory errors. Platform Action Events do not directly identify the
DRAM manufacturer, so the framework matches exact FRU ID and FRU text against
the lookback window. Every unambiguous action-result section is tagged with the
matched manufacturer and fanned out to that vendor. All relevant prior Samsung
action results and memory errors are passed to the DFA on every invocation.

```python
{
    "record_type": "platform_action",
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-18.cper",
        "section_index": 0,
        "is_newest": True,
        "window_index": 0,
    },
    "timestamp": "2026-09-23T16:35:00Z",
    "record_id": 1043,
    "cper_severity": "Platform Action Event",

        "action_id": "0x8001",
        "return_code": "0x01",
        "return_name": "Failed",
        "reason_code": "0x55",
        "successful": False,
        "additional_context": None,
        "cpad_record_id": "0x0000000000001234",
        "cpad_section_index": 0,
    },
    "correlation": {
        "method": "fru_id_and_text",
        "matched": True,
        "ambiguous": False,
        "source_error_cper": "record-17.cper",
        "source_error_section_index": 2,
    },
    "memory_target": {
        "channel": 0,
        "dimm": 1,
        "subchannel": 0,
        "rank": 0,
        "device": 3,
        "bank_group": 2,
        "bank": 3,
        "row": 1234,
        "column": 567,
        "beat_mask": [0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0021, 0x0000],
        "serial_number": "SERIAL",
        "part_number": "PART",
        "module_manufacturer_id": [0x04, 0xD5],
        "dram_manufacturer_id": [0x80, 0xCE],
        "spd_temperature": 40,
        "total_memory_bytes": 549755813888,
        "memory_organization": {
            "version": 1,
            "address_translation": "contoso-simple-v1",
            "dimm_size_gib": 64,
        },
        "memory_repair_capabilities": 0x07,
        "reserved": 0,
        "repairs": [
            {
                "subchannel": 0,
                "rank": 0,
                "device": 3,
                "bank_group": 2,
                "bank": 3,
                "count": 2,
            },
        ],
        "subcomponent": {
            "chiplet": 0,
            "controller": 0,
        },
    },
}
```

Correlation uses exact FRU ID and FRU text. When no older memory error matches:

```python
"correlation": {
    "method": "fru_id_and_text",
    "matched": False,
    "ambiguous": False,
},
"memory_target": None,
```

`ambiguous` is `True` when matching history contains more than one DRAM
manufacturer ID. A matched record adds `source_error_cper` and
`source_error_section_index` and supplies `memory_target`.

## Required Samsung result

`analyze()` must return an object containing exactly these three top-level
fields:

```python
{
    "fault": {
        "mode": "Row",
        "detail": "Single Row",
        "confidence": 92,
        "reason": "Repeated corrected errors on one DRAM row",
    },
    "cpads": [],
    "advisories": [],
}
```

`fault` may be `None`. `cpads` and `advisories` must be lists. The shim
currently treats `fault` and `advisories` as Samsung-owned diagnostic output;
only `cpads[].actions` are translated into grouped Contoso section requests.

### Multi-DIMM input

`records` may contain history for more than one physical DIMM — e.g. a 30 Day
lookback window on a host with several populated slots. `analyze()` may
consider every DIMM present, not only the one that triggered this call:

- `fault` still describes only the *triggering* DIMM (the newest record's
  own DIMM). The top-level shape is unchanged — one object or `None`.
- `cpads` may contain action requests for DIMMs other than the one
  described by `fault`. This requires no adapter change: a CPAD section's
  `source` only has to identify some `memory_error` record in the current
  input window (see `memory-vendor-analyzer-shim.md`'s "Event Source
  Reference"), not one belonging to the DIMM `fault` describes.
- `advisories` may include a one-line note about any other DIMM `analyze()`
  looked at, and may also flag when two or more DIMMs' failures appear
  related to each other rather than being independent. These are
  diagnostic text only, as with any other advisory.

### Console output

`analyzer_samsung.py` prints a summary of `fault`, `advisories`, and the
CPAD proposals it builds to stdout as it runs, for visibility during the
guided demo. This is operational logging, not part of the return contract.

Each CPAD proposal contains one or more actions:

```python
{
    "actions": [
        # Action objects documented below.
    ],
}
```

Every action object must contain exactly:

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "replace_dimm",
    "confidence": 95,
    "urgency": True,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
    },
    "reason": "Repair budget exhausted",
}
```

The action rules are:

- `source` must contain exactly `cper_file` and `section_index`.
- `source` must identify a `memory_error` record from the current input list;
  a Platform Action record cannot be the source of a new request.
- `confidence` must be an integer from 0 through 100; booleans are rejected.
- `urgency` must be a boolean selected by the Samsung analyzer.
- `parameters` must be an object.
- `reason` must be a non-empty string. It is diagnostic context and is not
  encoded into the Contoso action request.

## Supported actions

| Samsung action | CPAD ActionID | CPAD action | Parameters |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `cold_reboot` | `0x0002` | Power Cycle | Must be `{}` |
| `reseat_dimm` | `0x0003` | Reseat Part | FRU ID and text |
| `dance_dimm` | `0x0004` | Shuffle Part | FRU ID and text |
| `replace_dimm` | `0x0005` | Replace Part | FRU ID and text |
| `ppr` | `0x8001` | Post Package Repair | FRU plus complete PPR type and target |
| `page_offline` | `0x8002` | Page Offline | FRU plus `pages`, `page_ranges`, or both |
| `reboot_with_training` | `0x8003` | Reboot with Memory Retraining | Must be `{}` |

### Power Cycle (`cold_reboot`, `0x0002`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "cold_reboot",
    "confidence": 90,
    "urgency": True,
    "parameters": {},
    "reason": "A cold restart is required to recover the platform",
}
```

### Reseat DIMM (`reseat_dimm`, `0x0003`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "reseat_dimm",
    "confidence": 91,
    "urgency": False,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
    },
    "reason": "The fault pattern indicates a DIMM seating problem",
}
```

### DIMM dance (`dance_dimm`, `0x0004`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "dance_dimm",
    "confidence": 92,
    "urgency": False,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
    },
    "reason": "Move the DIMM to isolate the failing component",
}
```

### Replace DIMM (`replace_dimm`, `0x0005`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "replace_dimm",
    "confidence": 95,
    "urgency": True,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
    },
    "reason": "The available repair budget is exhausted",
}
```

Reseat Part, Shuffle Part, and Replace Part explicitly provide FRU ID and FRU
text for the CPAD descriptor; their encoded action bodies remain empty. Power
Cycle may omit FRU parameters and uses the newest CPER's unambiguous FRU as
correlation context. After policy approval, these standard actions are routed
to the simulated server-fleet control plane rather than submitted to the
Contoso endpoint.

### Post Package Repair (`ppr`, `0x8001`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "ppr",
    "confidence": 94,
    "urgency": False,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
        "ppr_type": 0x01,
        "chiplet": 0,
        "controller": 0,
        "channel": 0,
        "dimm": 1,
        "subchannel": 0,
        "rank": 0,
        "device": 3,
        "bank_group": 2,
        "bank": 3,
        "row": 1234,
    },
    "reason": "Repair the repeatedly failing DRAM row",
}
```

PPR parameters contain the two FRU fields plus exactly the eleven body fields
shown above:

| Parameter | Valid values |
| --- | --- |
| `ppr_type` | `0x01` runtime soft PPR, `0x02` boot-time soft PPR, or `0x04` boot-time hard PPR |
| `chiplet` | Integer `0..65535` |
| `controller` | Integer `0..65535` |
| `channel` | Integer `0..255` |
| `dimm` | Integer `0..255` |
| `subchannel` | Integer `0..255` |
| `rank` | Integer `0..255` |
| `device` | Integer `0..255` |
| `bank_group` | Integer `0..255` |
| `bank` | Integer `0..255` |
| `row` | Integer `0..4294967295` |

The Samsung analyzer must select the PPR type and copy the complete target into
the request. The Contoso analyzer does not infer missing coordinates from the
referenced memory-error record.

### Page Offline (`page_offline`, `0x8002`)

An action may identify individual pages:

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "page_offline",
    "confidence": 88,
    "urgency": False,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
        "pages": [
            0x0000000012345000,
            0x0000000012347000,
        ],
    },
    "reason": "Offline the pages containing recurring corrected errors",
}
```

It may identify ranges:

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "page_offline",
    "confidence": 89,
    "urgency": True,
    "parameters": {
        "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
        "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
        "page_ranges": [
            {
                "start_address": 0x0000000020000000,
                "page_count": 32,
            },
        ],
    },
    "reason": "Offline the physical range affected by the fault",
}
```

Or it may use both forms:

```python
"parameters": {
    "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
    "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
    "pages": [
        0x0000000012345000,
        0x0000000012347000,
    ],
    "page_ranges": [
        {
            "start_address": 0x0000000020000000,
            "page_count": 32,
        },
    ],
},
```

Beyond the two FRU fields, only `pages` and `page_ranges` are permitted. At
least one page list must be non-empty. Every physical address must be an
integer in the 52-bit physical address space and aligned to 4 KiB.
`page_count` must be an integer from 1 through `4294967295`, and the resulting
range must remain within the 52-bit address space.

In addition to `pages` and `page_ranges`, every Page Offline action requires
`fru_id` and `fru_text`. All pages represented by one action must belong to
that FRU. Pages belonging to another FRU require another action and therefore
another CPAD section. The adapter rejects overlapping pages assigned to
different FRUs.

The Contoso analyzer canonicalizes overlapping or adjacent pages, selects the
smallest PFN-list, range, or bitmap encoding, and divides large requests into
independently retryable, batch-correlated CPADs. The endpoint remains
stateless: it performs the request, emits a Platform Action Event, and does not
include offlined-page state in later CPERs.

### Reboot with memory training (`reboot_with_training`, `0x8003`)

```python
{
    "source": {
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
    },
    "action": "reboot_with_training",
    "confidence": 93,
    "urgency": True,
    "parameters": {},
    "reason": "Retrain memory on the next system reset",
}
```

The parameter object may be empty. The framework then uses the newest CPER's
single unambiguous FRU as correlation context. The endpoint records a pending
retraining request and performs it on the next supported system reset.

## Translation to the Contoso request

For example, the Samsung `replace_dimm` action above becomes:

```python
{
    "sections": [{
        "cper_file": "record-17.cper",
        "section_index": 2,
        "action_id": "0x0005",
        "confidence": 95,
        "urgency": True,
        "parameters": {
            "fru_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002",
            "fru_text": "DIMM A1",
        },
    }],
}
```

The adapter preserves each Samsung CPAD grouping, maps action names to
ActionIDs, moves the two source fields to each section request, and copies
confidence, urgency, and parameters. The Contoso analyzer then builds and
emits one binary multi-section CPAD per proposal.

Confidence and urgency are inputs to server-fleet policy. Policy may reject an
action based on either field and may prioritize an approved urgent action. The
endpoint does not use either field when executing the action.

## Analysis seam

`analyzer_samsung.py`'s `analyze(records)` delegates to the real DFA engine in
`samsung_dfa.py`, a Samsung-proprietary module, per this document's
`{"fault", "cpads", "advisories"}` contract.

`samsung_dfa.py` is Samsung intellectual property, available to customers
under an NDA and software license agreement — contact Samsung to obtain it.


With it in place, Samsung DRAM gets Samsung's own fault diagnosis and repair
recommendations instead of a generic heuristic. Without it, the
samsung_analyzer shim fails to load and Samsung errors fall back to the 'default' single-action
Contoso Analyzer every unrecognized vendor gets.

The adapter contract in this document is implementation-independent: any
conforming `analyze(records) -> {"fault", "cpads", "advisories"}` module can
be dropped in at that path, proprietary or not, without changing
`analyzer_samsung.py` or the Contoso shim contract.

See [Memory Vendor Analyzer Shim Interface](memory-vendor-analyzer-shim.md) for
the common shim flow and [Contoso CPAD Actions](../contoso-cpad-actions.md) for
the binary action formats.
